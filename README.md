King's Labs Portfolio Submission

Presentation Summary:

• Design - I gathered all the important info needed for job applications, pulling insights from my LinkedIn profile. 
           I made sure everything flowed naturally, covering Biography, education, work experience, and existing projects.
           I knew that my name, photo and 'about me' had to be at the beginning, so I just worked from that. Since the website is one page, I decided to 
           keep the contents quite simple.

• Programming - Taking a cue from the KLabs website, I figured out the coding structure and did some extra digging online for inspiration. 
           Using Django, React, and Tailwind, I wove all these insights into my portfolio. Having KLabs material and references all 
           helped to kickstart my journey into making this portfolio.
           
• Review - KLabs has been a game-changer for my confidence. Tackling my coding insecurities head-on, the step-by-step guidance made a world of difference. 
           With each project step, I realised I knew more than I thought. I admit that having enough confidence in myself was 
           always the hardest part for me because I was scared I didn't know enough.
           In the future, I would like to refine the frontend, so I can really turn this into a super sleek and professional-looking portfolio.
